# Choorts

My first Flutter project

A mobile application for guitar players that allows to keep track of your guitar repertoire, and be sure now that after D chord comes A chord... or vice versa.

# Application features
App at this stage of development allows to create and delete a song. Song consists of tempo value, strumming patterns and progressions (Tab or Chords), each of those things user can add to a song.
